# Welcome to UbiHome!

UbiHome is a single executable that allows you to integrate any device running an OS into your smart home.
It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use - similar to ESPHome.

- [Execute a command on a device](./examples/display_notification/index.md) based on a trigger in home assistant.
- [Monitor the status of a device](./examples/system_ressources/index.md) with a custom command.
- Integrate all of your _one off python scripts^TM^_ without thinking about connectivity or setting up yet another service.

See the [getting started](getting_started/index.md) guide for installation instructions.

Explore the [examples](examples/index.md) to see how to use UbiHome.
